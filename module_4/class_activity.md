# Class Activity: Think Like an Analyst

## Objective:
Students will practice the mindset and approach of a data analyst by working through a real-world problem, using data to derive insights and present actionable recommendations.

---

## Activity Breakdown:

### 1. Scenario Setup (10 minutes)
- **Goal**: Give students a real-world problem to solve using data.
- **Materials**: Provide a dataset (e.g., sales data, customer survey data, or website traffic data) and the problem statement.
- **Example Scenario**:
  > "You are hired as a data analyst for a retail company. Your task is to analyze the sales data and help the company understand how to increase profits in the upcoming quarter."

  **Questions to solve**:
  - What are the current trends in sales?
  - Which products are performing well, and which are underperforming?
  - Are there any patterns in customer demographics or purchasing behaviors?

---

### 2. Group Analysis & Exploration (20 minutes)
- **Goal**: Students will work in small groups to explore the data, ask the right questions, and prepare for analysis.
- **Instructions**:
  - Break students into groups of 3-4.
  - Each group must identify the key questions they want to answer to solve the problem. Encourage them to **break down** the larger problem into smaller, focused questions (e.g., What product categories drive the most revenue?).
  - They should also **discuss assumptions** they need to verify and identify potential data limitations.
- **Deliverable**: Groups submit their top 3 questions and a brief plan for their analysis approach (e.g., look at product performance by region, analyze customer age groups, etc.).

---

### 3. Data Analysis and Visualization (30 minutes)
- **Goal**: Students conduct analysis using basic tools (Excel, Google Sheets, or Python if appropriate) and begin to look for insights in the dataset.
- **Instructions**:
  - Guide students to use exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques:
    - **Descriptive statistics**: Mean, median, mode for numerical data.
    - **Visualizations**: Create graphs, charts (bar charts, pie charts, etc.) to visualize trends and patterns.
    - **Trends and Anomalies**: Look for any spikes or drops in sales or customer activity.
  - Encourage students to document their findings with screenshots, charts, and notes.
- **Deliverable**: Groups prepare a list of initial insights and supporting data visualizations.

---

### 4. Develop Insights and Recommendations (15 minutes)
- **Goal**: Students will transition from analysis to actionable insights and recommendations.
- **Instructions**:
  - Each group takes their findings and considers: What are the key takeaways? How can these insights inform a strategy?
  - They should come up with 2-3 practical recommendations for the company based on their analysis (e.g., "Increase marketing spend for product X in region Y because sales data shows high potential there").
- **Deliverable**: A short report or presentation slide summarizing their findings and recommendations.

---

### 5. Presentation and Discussion (25 minutes)
- **Goal**: Groups share their findings with the class, encouraging peer feedback and discussion.
- **Instructions**:
  - Each group presents for 3-5 minutes, focusing on:
    1. The problem they addressed.
    2. Their key data insights.
    3. Recommendations they derived from the analysis.
  - Encourage classmates to ask questions and provide feedback, simulating the real-world process of peer review or stakeholder feedback.
- **Wrap-up**: The class can vote on the most compelling recommendations or discuss how different insights from each group could be combined for a stronger overall strategy.

---

### 6. Reflection and Key Takeaways (10 minutes)
- **Goal**: Encourage students to reflect on the process and the skills they used.
- **Discussion Prompts**:
  - What challenges did you face during analysis?
  - How did you decide which data was most important to focus on?
  - What would you do differently in the future as an analyst?
  - How did your approach change after seeing other groupsâ€™ presentations?

---

## Optional Additions:
- **Bonus Task**: Have students write a one-page reflection on what they learned about thinking like an analyst.
- **Real-World Application**: Bring in a guest speaker or show a short video on how analysts in the industry approach similar problems.

---

## Assessment Criteria:
- **Analysis Quality**: Did the group correctly identify and analyze the right data?
- **Insights & Recommendations**: Were the insights actionable and backed by data?
- **Communication**: Was the presentation clear and well-structured?

---

This activity promotes collaboration, critical thinking, and the practical application of analytical skills. It gives students a chance to practice the full process from problem definition to insight generation and presentation, simulating real-world scenarios they might face in data analytics.
